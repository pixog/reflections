What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-Git creates all the necessary backend files (repository) in order to track your commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-Stores only the files for the next commit. Useful because you can customize your commits to only include logically related files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-Only add files that include changes related to one logical change...
